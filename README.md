# DISCRETE-STRUCTURE
Discrete Structures are closely related to Computer Science because they provide the mathematical foundation for many core concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and logic. Topics like sets, graphs, and proofs help explain how problems are modeled and solved efficiently in computer science. Learning discrete structures has improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for writing correct and efficient programs.
