# DISCRETE-STRUCTURE
Discrete Structures are closely related to Computer Science because they provide the mathematical foundation for many core concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and logic. Topics like sets, graphs, and proofs help explain how problems are modeled and solved efficiently in computer science. Learning discrete structures has improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for writing correct and efficient programs.

## Topic
CHAPTER 1: SET THEORY & LOGIC  
CHAPTER 2: RELATIONS & FUNCTIONS  
CHAPTER 3: COUNTING METHODS & PROBABILITY  
CHAPTER 4: GRAPH THEORY  
CHAPTER 5: FINITE AUTOMATA  

## [Assignment 1](https://github.com/alicegan524/DISCRETE-STRUCTURE/blob/main/DS%20ASSIGN%201.pdf)
This assignment helped me understand set theory and logic more clearly. Working with sets taught me how to use operations like union, intersection, and complements correctly. The logic questions helped me practice writing clear statements and checking whether arguments were true or false. Some parts were challenging at first, but step-by-step practice made them easier. Overall, the assignment improved my logical thinking and helped me understand these topics better.

## [Assignment 2](https://github.com/alicegan524/DISCRETE-STRUCTURE/blob/main/DS%20ASSIGN%202.pdf)
This assignment helped me understand relations and functions better. I learned how to describe relationships between sets and how functions connect elements from one set to another. Some problems, like checking if a function is one-to-one or onto, were tricky at first, but practicing step by step made them easier. Overall, the assignment improved my understanding of these concepts and how to use them in problems.
